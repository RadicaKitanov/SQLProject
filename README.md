# SQLProject

This project involves setting up a system to manage employee salaries and benefits for a company with multiple departments and locations. The goal is to ensure that employees are fairly distributed across departments and locations, and that their salaries are calculated accurately and in compliance with company policies and labor regulations.

Specifically, the task includes generating salary data for the past 20 years, with random gross amounts between certain ranges and corresponding net amounts. It also involves calculating regular work, bonus, and overtime amounts, as well as vacation and sick leave days for each employee based on certain criteria. The task requires using SQL scripts to insert and manipulate data, and performing checks to ensure data accuracy and compliance.

Overall, the task is about creating a comprehensive system to manage employee salaries and benefits in a fair, accurate, and compliant manner for a company with multiple departments and locations.
